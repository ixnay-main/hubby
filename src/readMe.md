``` node nodejs_upload_file.js```

*check line 13 in nodejs_upload_file.js and replace with your route - will not work otherwise*

issues will be caused by the radata folder, delete it and try again, or write some better code

this repo takes a file upload of text, chucks it in temphome, then and allows for interaction with gun.

it does not currently store this data under a gun hash, or allow for multiple file uploads

p.s. we need to make vid playthrus a thing( maybe some cool backing soundtracks, circa 2005 school project animations )
